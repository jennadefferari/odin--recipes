    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablesspoons stevia</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce</li>
        <li>1 cup soymilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>in a large bowl, mix flour, stevia, baking powder, and salt. mix thoroughly before making a well in the center. Then add your milk, applesauce, vanilla, and oil. Mix until smooth; definatley do not want lumps. </li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or frying pan on medium heat. light oil or spray the pan. After a moment, check if your pan is ready by dropping a tiny amount of batter on the pan and checking to see if it cooks. Once the pan is ready, spoon batter on using a spoon or scoop. you can control the size of the pancakes here. personally, I enjoy mini pancakes and use about a spoonful. However, if you want standard sized pancakes use approximatley 1/4 cup for each pancake.</li>
        <li>Cook each pancake on either side, browning both. if you are unsure when your pancake is ready to flip, look for bubbles forming in the batter. flip when at least a few bubbles have formed and give it about a minute on it's other side.</li>
        <li>Serve these bad boys hot with vegan butter and sugarfree syrup.</li>
    </ol>
